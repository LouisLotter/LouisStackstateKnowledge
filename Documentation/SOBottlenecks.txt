Summary

Summary
3
Critical Delays:  Unplanned stability work (data corruption fix) consumed Q3/Q4 backend capacity, delaying "StackPacks 2.0" by 2 months.
Adoption Bottlenecks: Large accounts (e.g., OOCL, Dictu) are blocking adoption due to missing Team-level RBAC and Advanced Logs capabilities.
Resourcing Gap: Velocity has decreased due to the recent churn of SUSE Security engineers, leaving the current roadmap over-committed.
Strategic Risk: Continuing the current plan risks low adoption and customer churn as critical needs (Logs/RBAC) are pushed too far into 2026/2027.
Decision Required:
Immediate Action: Delay SUSE Security integration to prioritize delivery of Team RBAC and Improved Logs.
Recovery Plan: Backfill churned engineers to form a 3rd team, ensuring Security Hub can be delivered later with regained velocity.
OR: Accept the business risk

A. SUSE Observability is not yet (well) integrated with other ECM products
B. Customers are asking to integrate their OpenTelemetry based observability data in SUSE Observability
Both A and B are delivered via StackPacks 2.0 which is a way to support any technology outside K8S (e.g. workloads running on top of K8S but also workloads running on Linux) via OpenTelemetry
This Epic is currently being developed and is +/- 60% ready

2. Stability

Issue description

10
Next to this there is clear and an huge increase in support tickets (>100 per month for L1 support) in general, showing increased adoption in general. This did cause extra load on the team for L3 support reducing velocity.
Since September FY25 there have been multiple data corruption reports coming in from our biggest customers
Deep investigation into this issue resulted in extra effort in Chaos testing, timeout management and other solutions
We found  a few issues which can be the cause of this and hope that this is resolved, the issue however does not show in most environments and only time and more (chaos) testing will ensure this is the case.

Solutions
11
For the majority of October and November a big part of the backend team has been focussed on resolving stability issues which in most cases related to data-corruption issues 
With the release 2.6.0 - 2.6.3 (11/25/25) we expect many of the issues to be resolved.
The issue however does not show in most environments and only time and more (chaos) testing will ensure this is the case.

3. Team level administration via RBAC 
Internal use only, confidential

Issue description
13
Customers aim to provide their internal teams (e.g. development teams) with an Observability solution
The current RBAC model provides the ability to segregate the data to the different teams, so they only see their own data.
Those internal teams also have the need to define their own Dashboards, Overview pages, Monitors, Notification Channels, Extensions (StackPacks)
Currently only global admin users can define those which is not good enough for some of the larger customers. They see this as a must have requirement.
Internal use only, confidential

Solutions
14
We did not yet plan a solution for this. The feedback came up after the release of RBAC in September 2025.
The feedback is that the released RBAC model is not good enough for their use-case supporting their teams with an Observability solution where the teams can manage their own configuration.
A very rough estimate to solve this is an Epic which takes 1 team for about 4-6 months.

4. Logs

Issue description
16
Extended logs support to support customers who see this as a need to have before they can move to SUSE Observability
Support for OpenTelemetry Logs
Currently only Pod logs are supported
Support for Host level Logs to troubleshoot issues related to the host running k8S on and/ or to collect logs from other systems. 
The ability to explore logs with a logs Explorer and see the logs for specific workloads (e.g. service, job, etc.)
Currently logs can only be accessed via pods
Have the ability to send logs to external systems

Architecture Constraints
The "Minimum Running an Observability platform" Tax. You cannot run a reliable cluster with less than 3 small nodes, even if the traffic is tiny.
Efficiency improves slightly, but you are still dominated by the fixed baseline cost of running the control plane (alert manager, query frontends).
The Transition Zone. Your fixed control plane costs are now amortized. You start adding "data nodes" (Ingesters) to handle the flow.
Standard efficiency. At this size, you likely separate your "Write" path (ingestion) from your "Read" path (querying) to prevent dashboard loading from killing ingestion.
Optimization Sweet Spot. You are large enough to tune resource requests but small enough that complexity hasn't exploded.
Complexity enters. You introduce caching layers (Memcached/Redis) to speed up queries, which adds slightly to the vCPU count but protects the core DB.
High Scale. You can now dedicate specific heavy nodes to compaction and compression. Data density per vCPU improves significantly.
Massive Scale Efficiency. Throughput is massive, but because you are likely sampling traces (e.g., 10%) and filtering logs, the relative footprint is tiny.
The following table estimates the Backend vCPU required to monitor the Target vCPU, assuming a standard HA self-hosted stack (Metrics + Logs + Traces). Source: Gemini. This is just as a reference for where we are standing (next slide).

Solutions
21
Short term:
The ability to run Observability as a Hosted Solution (PCC 12/04/2025) supporting the smaller scale setup
The removal of Elasticsearch when replacing the Logs storage to support the other Logs related demands
Longer term (2027):
Further optimizations (not yet planned)

6. GitOps/ ArgoCD support 
Internal use only, confidential

Issue description

23
SUSE Observability currently lacks a unified Infrastructure as Code strategy. Core concepts are not yet defined as CRDs, and we are missing a Terraform provider. Additionally, there is no documentation, ArgoCD- or Fleet- integration examples, preventing users from implementing fully declarative configurations.
Internal use only, confidential

Solutions

24
Medium term:
Document ArgoCD usage
Longer term (2027):
Make sure IaC concepts for everything in SUSE Observability is documented.
Make sure most/ all of SUSE Observability concepts can be defined as CRD’s or alternative IaC concepts.
Full support for Fleet including examples.
Create an terraform provider using the documentation and concepts.

7. Ease of installation/ maintenance 
Internal use only, confidential

Issue description

26
The current Rancher integration lacks a single-click installation for the Platform. Users are forced to provide extensive manual input and edit complex values files. Additionally, diagnosing runtime or configuration errors is difficult due to the absence of automated validation tools or clear resolution paths.
Internal use only, confidential

Solution

27
Short term:
This is not (yet) seen as the biggest issue for customers not adoption the solution.
Longer term (2027):
Single click installation of the SUSE Observability Agent inside Rancher and the single click installation of the Observability platform
Minimize Manual Configuration: Ensure that installations, especially through Rancher, require minimal user input and no extensive values file edits.
Make sure any (runtime/ configuration) issue can easily be found and resolved (e.g. an external validation app)

Advice

Solutions
37
A. Delay the integration of SUSE Security to make room for:
Team level administration via RBAC (3)
Improved logs (4)
B. Replace the churned SUSE Security engineers to form a 3th team to gain velocity and work on SUSE Security integration
C. Continue with current plan and accept potential churn and lower addoption for SUSE Observability
Internal use only, confidential

Advice
38
Execute on A (Delay integration of SUSE Security) and B (add replacements for SUSE Security engineers)
This will in the short term delay the Delivery of SUSE Security Hub but will ensure we can deliver Security Hub in a timely manner.
