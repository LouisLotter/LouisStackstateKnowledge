# Repository Improvements for Claude Code Effectiveness

Tasks identified from repo analysis. Work through these one at a time.

## Quick Wins (Do First)

- [ ] **Rename Todo/ to todo/** - Fix capitalization to match other directories
- [ ] **Standardize date format** - Document ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) as standard in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] **Document file extension conventions** - Add .txt vs .md guidance to CLAUDE.md
- [ ] **Create root README.md** - Simple navigation pointing to CLAUDE.md

## Cleanup Tasks

- [ ] **Handle initiatives/security-hub/** - Either populate with content or remove if not active
- [ ] **Consolidate active/todo/** - Decide: activate it properly or remove in favor of this task tracking approach
- [ ] **Create exports/INDEX.md** - Summary of each export file (date range, purpose, key findings)

## Claude Code Enhancements

- [ ] **Add Quick Tasks section to CLAUDE.md** - Common commands at the top for easy reference
- [ ] **Create templates/ directory** - Add reusable document templates:
  - [ ] 1on1-template.md
  - [ ] weekly-update-template.md
- [ ] **Add writing guidelines checker prompt** - Prompt to scan drafts for em-dashes and AI-tell patterns

## Structural Improvements

- [ ] **Create _archive/ directory** - For completed/historical work
- [ ] **Create initiatives/ROADMAP.md** - Document cross-initiative dependencies (e.g., Security Hub depends on Stackpacks 2.0)

## Future Automation Ideas (Reference)

These are opportunities, not immediate tasks:
- Automated weekly update generation from Jira exports
- Monthly customer feedback trend summaries
- 1:1 prep talking points generation from recent activity
- Blog draft quality checks against writing guidelines
