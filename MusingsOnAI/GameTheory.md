# AI Productivity: Maximizing Our Investment

## Context

SUSE's 2026 organizational goals include:

**Goal 1: AI Productivity & Adoption**
- 20% productivity gain / 30% adoption by Q2
- 40% productivity gain / 80% adoption by Q4

**Goal 3: R&D Cost Efficiency**
- Decrease R&D cost of revenue to 18% by FY27 through AI and process optimization

These are good goals. The question is: how do we get the most value from them?

## The Strategic Question

There's a risk that we interpret "AI productivity" as "do the same work with fewer people." I'd like to offer a different framing: **AI productivity should mean "do significantly more with the people we have."**

Here's why the distinction matters:

### 1. The Competitive Math

Every company in our space has access to the same AI tools. If everyone gets 40% more productive:

| Scenario | Team Size | AI Multiplier | Effective Output |
|----------|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| Competitor (growing) | 1,000 engineers | 1.4x | 1,400 |
| SUSE (frozen) | 500 engineers | 1.4x | 700 |

The productivity gain is real, but the absolute gap hasn't closed — it's grown proportionally. If competitors use AI *and* continue hiring, they pull ahead in absolute terms while we celebrate relative efficiency.

AI is table stakes, not competitive advantage.

### 2. The "Red Queen" Effect

In evolutionary biology, the Red Queen hypothesis says you have to keep running just to stay in place. AI productivity is similar: if everyone speeds up by 40%, that 40% becomes the new baseline for survival, not a margin we can bank.

This applies across all of SUSE — Rancher, NeuVector, Linux, Observability. Every product line is competing against well-funded rivals who are adopting the same tools.

### 3. The EU Reality

As a European company, SUSE operates under stricter compliance and security requirements (GDPR, AI Act, data residency). US competitors will likely adopt AI tools faster and with fewer constraints. 

To compete on equal footing, we need to be *more* strategic about human capacity, not less. The regulatory overhead is real — we can't out-speed Silicon Valley on AI adoption, so we need to out-think them on where we deploy our people.

### 4. The Talent Window

The engineers who understand how to leverage AI effectively are being hired *now*. A prolonged hiring freeze across SUSE means:
- We miss the window to acquire AI-native talent
- Our existing engineers carry heavier loads, increasing burnout risk
- Competitors build teams that compound their AI productivity gains

## The Risk of "Efficiency Thinking"

When organizations optimize purely for cost efficiency, they often cut the slack that enables:
- **Innovation** — new products, new markets, strategic bets
- **Resilience** — ability to absorb unexpected challenges
- **Speed** — capacity to pursue opportunities when they arise

A 40% productivity gain used to reduce headcount is a one-time saving. A 40% productivity gain used to increase output is a compounding advantage.

## Recommendation

Frame AI productivity as an **investment in capability expansion**, not cost reduction:

1. **Measure output growth, not just efficiency** — Across SUSE, are we shipping more? Entering new markets? Closing competitive gaps? Or just maintaining the same output with fewer people?

2. **Protect strategic hiring** — Even modest additions in key areas could multiply the productivity gains we're already seeing. The goal should be selective growth, not a blanket freeze.

3. **Benchmark against competitors** — What are Red Hat, Canonical, VMware, and our cloud-native competitors shipping? Are we keeping pace in absolute terms, or just relative to our own baseline?

4. **Reframe the narrative** — "AI lets us do more" is a growth story. "AI lets us cut costs" is a contraction story. Both may be true, but which one do we want to tell the market, our customers, and our talent pool?

## The Bottom Line

If SUSE treats AI as a reason to freeze hiring, we are effectively shrinking our "base" while the rest of the industry expands theirs. 

The goal shouldn't be "do the same with less." It should be **"do exponentially more with what we have — and grow strategically where it matters."**

## Original Notes

<details>
<summary>Initial thinking (Gemini prompt & response)</summary>

**Prompt:**
"I work for a big corporate SUSE. We have the following two org goals... There is a hiring freeze going on and a lot of FUD about AI causing the executive team to not hire people. So they think they can reach the cost efficiency goal with a hiring freeze and AI productivity etc. But I think this is extremely misguided. Basic game theory tells me that even if we speed up by 2x using AI our competitors are likely to do the same. Actually I think they may speed up more than us as they are US based and are less paranoid about AI than we are in the EU. Firstly do you agree? And secondly how can I explain the mistake in their thinking?"

**Initial framing (too confrontational for upward communication):**

Subject: Why AI efficiency is an "Arms Race," not a "Cost Saving"

- The "Red Queen" Effect: If AI makes everyone 40% faster, that 40% isn't a "saving"—it becomes the new baseline for survival.
- The Capacity Gap: If US competitors use AI and keep hiring, their absolute output will dwarf ours.
- The EU Tax: As an EU company, our compliance/security bar is higher. Our US rivals will likely "move faster" with AI.
- The Bottom Line: If we treat AI as a reason to freeze hiring, we are effectively shrinking our "base" while the rest of the industry is expanding theirs.
