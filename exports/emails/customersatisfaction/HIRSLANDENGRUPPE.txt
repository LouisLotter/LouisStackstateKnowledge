Hi Mark,

I received the following customer feedback on SUSE Observability:
Deployment model (Helm charts) is insufficient to satisfactory resolve dependencies and operational complexities of all the components of the product, requiring manual troubleshooting and guessing which one is not working correctly. Having an operator/controller to manage and monitor deployment state would go a long way in improving resiliency and simplifying operations.

Thanks,
David
