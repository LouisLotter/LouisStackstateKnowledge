Team Member
Goal Setting

Coaching conversation cards 7

The main goal-setting activity starts at the beginning of the
financial year; however, goals should be discussed regularly
and adapted based on the changing demands of the team.
You and your team members should regularly review and
refresh goals together.
Your team members should feel complete ownership of their
goals. They should come to goal-setting meetings clear on the
goals of the team and with suggestions on their own goals to
support the delivery of the team and functional goals.

Here are some tips to do this really well with your team
members:
▪ Take time to do this well: clear goals are key to an effective
relationship with your team
▪ Ensure you are clear on your own goals and that you have
communicated the team goals to the team ahead of this
meeting.
▪ Coach your team member to ensure their goals are clear,
tangible and stretching, but are also attainable, relevant,
time-bound and measurable.
