# Todo - December 10, 2025

## Follow-ups from 1:1 with Sheng

### 1. Test Coverage & Duration Report
- [ ] Ask QA team (Daniel, Raju, Yash) for a report on:
  - Current test coverage (what's covered, what's not)
  - Test execution times (how long do full test runs take?)
  - Breakdown by test type (unit, integration, E2E, Playwright)
- **Why:** Couldn't answer questions about this in the meeting, need to be better prepared

### 2. StackGraph Rewrite - Make Time for Team
- [ ] Review current sprint/backlog and carve out capacity
- [ ] Discuss with Remco/Bram about allocating dedicated time
- [ ] Consider: Should this be a formal epic with protected time?
- **Context:** Team needs space to continue this work alongside other priorities

### 3. NeuVector Project Access
- [ ] File EIO ticket to get admin access to https://github.com/orgs/neuvector/projects/6
- [ ] Alternative: Confirm if donating to Kubewarden is still the plan (Flavio has admin there)
- **Blocker:** Bin left and no one can manage the project currently
