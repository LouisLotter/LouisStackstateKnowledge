## DKIM Alert Follow-up

Status: Resolved/Explained

The DKIM alert was for the playground environment (observability.suse.com), which doesn't send emails - no functional impact. AWS SES was partially configured for email but DKIM was never completed (DNS records weren't added), triggering security alerts when verification timed out.

Vladimir handled a similar issue a few weeks ago - same root cause. Remco created a ticket to clean this up properly - either complete the DKIM setup or remove the partial email configuration to stop recurring alerts.

Fedor is handling it now that he's back.



Ask about equity- Anton asked.
