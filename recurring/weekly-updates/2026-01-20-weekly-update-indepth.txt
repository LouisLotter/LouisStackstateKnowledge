================================================================================
KEY OBSERVATIONS FOR 1:1 WITH SHENG
================================================================================

WINS THIS WEEK:
1. v2.7.0 Released Successfully
   - Dashboarding is live - our #1 customer-requested feature
   - 9 months of development shipped
   - SaaS deployed, docs published, tenants updated

2. Biome Migration Major Milestone
   - ESLint fully replaced by Biome
   - Parent epic STAC-24016 closed
   - twin.macro patterns 1-4, 7 complete
   - Only patterns 5 & 6 remaining

3. OTel Mapping API Epic Complete
   - All 5 sub-tasks merged
   - Foundation for Security Hub and other integrations
   - Lukasz delivered entire API

4. StackGraph WAL Mismatch Fixed
   - Issue filed with Apache HBase (HBASE-29784)
   - Fix shipped in stackgraph bump

5. Infrastructure Improvements
   - Zookeeper HA fix for ClickHouse
   - Parallel restore handling complete
   - Values generation helm chart replacement in review


CONCERNS / RISKS:
1. Bosch Memory Pressure
   - Still investigating readcache removal
   - Bram stretched between multiple priorities
   - May need dedicated focus time

2. Helm Chart Refactoring Scope
   - STAC-23392 is 13 story points
   - Major change to installation flow
   - Needs careful review and testing

3. ComponentPresentation Design Complexity
   - Multiple design stories in progress
   - API design, binding/rank fields, examples
   - Need to converge on approach


TALKING POINTS FOR SHENG:

1. v2.7.0 Success
   - "Dashboarding shipped successfully. This was our biggest feature in 
     9 months and addresses our #1 customer request."

2. Technical Debt Progress
   - "Biome migration is nearly complete. ESLint fully replaced, just 
     finishing twin.macro cleanup. This significantly improves our 
     frontend developer experience."

3. Stackpacks 2.0 Foundation
   - "OTel Mapping API is complete. Now focused on ComponentPresentation 
     design - this is the more complex piece that enables custom UIs."

4. OTel Collector Scaling
   - "Lukasz is load testing the collector scaling. Initial results show 
     we can scale from 7k to 17k traces/sec with 4 collectors. Good 
     progress on understanding our limits."


QUESTIONS TO ASK SHENG:
1. v2.7.0 feedback - any early customer reactions to dashboarding?
2. Security Hub timeline - any updates after the scope discussion?
3. Bosch engagement - should we prioritize memory pressure work?
4. 2026 goals finalization - any updates on the March stability target?

RELEASE NOTES - v2.7.0 (SHIPPED)
================================================================================

[Dashboards] SUSE Observability now includes Dashboards, allowing you to 
visualize data from various components like business processes, user flows, 
and data pipelines in a single location. Includes timeseries charts, bar 
charts, gauges, stat widgets, and markdown fields. Supports variables, 
thresholds, and customization.

[Platform] Fixed StackGraph corruption issue that could arise due to 
long-running scans.

[Platform] Fix issue where several pods (hbase, tephra) go OOM on SLES 16 
due to cgroups v2.

[Platform] Create a small logging daemon that observes the quorum of 
redundant services in the platform installation.

[Platform] Fix issue where kafka init container gets stuck upon new install.

[Agent] Fix issue where the kubernetes rbac agent would not use the defined 
resources from the values file.

[Agent] Fix issue where the rbac-agent does not refresh its serviceaccount 
token, causing it to lose authentication.

[Agent] Avoid logging credentials from the splunk integration when debugging 
is enabled.

[Agent] Disabled saved searches in splunk will now be ignored by the splunk 
check.

Plus: Improved error handling, PV/PVC metric chart fixes, YAML parsing fixes, 
Slack channel ID support for large workspaces, and more.
