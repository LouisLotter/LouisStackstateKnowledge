KEY OBSERVATIONS FOR 1:1 WITH SHENG
================================================================================

WINS THIS WEEK:
1. v2.7.0 Release Progress
   - SaaS rolled out, nightly tested, version frozen
   - Only docs MR and public release remaining
   - Dashboarding is the flagship feature - 9 months of work shipping

2. Stackpacks 2.0 OTel Mapping API Complete
   - All 5 sub-tasks done (handlers, permissions, OpenAPI spec, code gen, DTO)
   - Lukasz delivered the entire API in this sprint
   - Foundation for other teams to build integrations

3. Documentation Sprint Productive
   - ComponentPresentation docs done
   - Stackpack CLI docs done
   - Preview docs feature flag done
   - Monitors/metrics binding docs in progress

4. Rabobank Issue Resolved
   - Splunk disabled saved searches fix shipped
   - Customer was blocked, now unblocked


CONCERNS / RISKS:
1. StackGraph Stability
   - New issues: WAL mismatch on chaos, Bosch memory pressure
   - Bram is stretched between agent work and stability fixes
   - This is ongoing - not getting worse but not fully resolved

2. v2.7.0 Release Timing
   - Target was Jan 12, we're at Jan 14 with docs/publish pending
   - Minor slip but should complete this week

3. Biome Migration Scope
   - 100+ GitLab references for ESLint replacement
   - twin.macro patterns more complex than expected
   - Good progress but will extend into next sprint


TALKING POINTS FOR SHENG:

1. Release Readiness
   - "v2.7.0 is essentially done - SaaS deployed, just finalizing docs and 
     public release. Dashboarding is our biggest feature in 9 months."

2. Stackpacks 2.0 Momentum
   - "OTel Mapping API is complete. This unblocks Security Hub and other 
     teams wanting to extend the platform. Documentation is progressing well."

3. Team Capacity
   - "Bram is juggling agent upstream merge, StackGraph stability, and 
     Splunk customer issues. May need to discuss prioritization if new 
     stability issues emerge."

4. Technical Debt Progress
   - "Biome migration is cleaning up our frontend tooling. Anton is making 
     steady progress but it's a larger effort than initially scoped."


QUESTIONS TO ASK SHENG:
1. Any feedback from stakeholders on dashboarding preview?
2. Security Hub timeline - any updates from Mark on scope clarification?
3. StackGraph rewrite decision - any movement on the ClickHouse evaluation?
4. 2026 goals - any updates on the March stability target vs StackGraph rewrite tension?
