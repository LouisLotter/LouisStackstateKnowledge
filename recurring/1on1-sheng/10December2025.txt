# 1:1 with Sheng - December 10, 2025

## 1. Goals Discussion
- **Question:** Are we doing big team goals again or individual goals?
- **Note:** Due date is coming up soon
- **Action needed:** Clarify format and timeline

## 2. Dashboards Release
- Target: After new year
- Status: In final stages (UI tests, docs, variable handling fixes in review)

## 3. QA / Test Automation Progress
- QASE Beest integration live: https://app.qase.io/run/STACKSTATE/dashboard/36
is it all Beest tests ? why is it so fast.

**Proposed Action Items for Test Coverage Expansion:**
1. **Playwright → QASE Integration**
   - Use Playwright for release validation within QASE framework
2. **Rancher Test Scenarios**
   - Add downstream cluster configurations
   - StackState deployment scenarios in those environments
3. **CLI Test Coverage**
   - Scenarios across BEEST, Pipeline, and QASE
4. **UI Test Scenarios**
   - Extend coverage for existing components
   - Add scenarios for new features (e.g., Dashboards)






## 4. NeuVector Project Access Issue (BLOCKER)
- **Problem:** No access to https://github.com/orgs/neuvector/projects/6
- **Root cause:** Bin left, no one has admin access
- **Options:**
  1. Get admin access granted to someone on the team
  2. Donate project to Kubewarden now (Flavio has admin there) - simplifies things

**Recommendation:** Push for option 2 if donation was already planned. Less overhead.

## Tips for the Discussion

**On Goals:**
- Come prepared with a suggestion (team vs individual) and your preference
- If team goals worked well before, advocate for continuity

**On Dashboards:**
- "After new year" is vague - try to pin down a more specific target (early Jan? mid-Jan?)
- Mention the main blockers if asked (UI freeze issue, docs)

**On NeuVector:**
- This is a blocker - frame it as needing a decision today
- Have a clear recommendation ready (sounds like Kubewarden donation is cleaner)
- Ask: "Can we make this decision now so we're not stuck?"


TODO

How long does the nightly test run take.
Full report of all the testing we have. coverage etc.

The Rewrite needs to happen Stackgraph.
