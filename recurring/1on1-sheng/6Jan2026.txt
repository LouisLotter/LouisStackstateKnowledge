## DKIM Alert Follow-up

Status: Resolved/Explained

The DKIM alert was for the playground environment (observability.suse.com), which doesn't send emails - no functional impact. AWS SES was partially configured for email but DKIM was never completed (DNS records weren't added), triggering security alerts when verification timed out.

Vladimir handled a similar issue a few weeks ago - same root cause. Remco created a ticket to clean this up properly - either complete the DKIM setup or remove the partial email configuration to stop recurring alerts.

Fedor is handling it now that he's back.

- Ask about equity- Anton asked.

- Ask if it's ok to just archive our previous goals.

- My ASR.

- Goal related to process and network enforcer



Todo:

- Expense mapping remind everyone.
- When is our stocks bein valued again.
--CVEs again (Remco): it seems that Golang libraries (specifically its standard library) is one of the biggest contributors to our CVEs (at least with the highest amount of changes). We should start focusing on automating these updates (for example for our Stackstate images: sts-toolbox -> base image -> stackstate). We also got a tentative offer to help from Guilherme Macedo from the security team (he knows how updatecli and renovate bot are setup on Rancher github repositories)
Louis checks out with guilherme whether he helps us with renovatebot and that (maybe reach out to manager?). 
Is he willing to learn Gitlab ? Remco says yes. I should highlight to him that it works very differently.
