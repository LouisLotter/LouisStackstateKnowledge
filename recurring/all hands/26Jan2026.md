## Fedor Zhdanov

**4 high-impact tickets completed**

Fedor tackled some gnarly infrastructure problems this period.

**Key Contributions:**
- Fixed Kafka and ClickHouse docker image builds (failing for ~5 months due to Bitnami images becoming unavailable after Broadcom acquisition)

- Delivered settings backup restore CLI command

Fedor's work may have fewer tickets, but each one removed real blockers for the team and customers.
