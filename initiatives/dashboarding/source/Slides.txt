Dashboards in SUSE Observability

Why?
The #1 requested feature by customers
Visualize data from different components in one place, for example:
Business processes
User flows through application
Data processing pipelines
Troubleshooting: Create ad-hoc dashboards while investigating an incident
Easier migration from tools like Grafana + Prometheus:
Users already know dashboards
Recreating Grafana dashboards in SUSE Observability
Quick and easy way to visualize user-defined metrics

Create private dashboards
And make dashboards “public” (for everyone with access to SUSE Observability)
Widgets supported:
Visualizing metrics: 
timeseries chart 📈
bar chart 📊
Gauge 
stats
Markdown
Define variables on the dashboard to use in queries and text fields
Dashboards can be included in StackPacks (always public)
Data shown is subject to RBAC permissions
Integrated into SUSE Observability

Creating a new dashboard
Use one of our dashboards in the SUSE Observability stackpack, maybe lightly customized for the demo

Use OTEL demo or sock-shop at time of problem
Show:
Open component, add response time or error metric to a newly created dashboard
Open a few more components and pin some metrics, add them in one go to the dashboard
Open dashboard, organize a bit, save and make public to share link with someone else (Anton or Sam?)
Show links back to components
They open dashboard and can continue troubleshooting
