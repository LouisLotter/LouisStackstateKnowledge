# Louis Lotter | 2026

*A living document. Review monthly. Be honest.*

---

## The Essence

2025 was surviving, then recovering. I ended the year stronger than I started it.

2026 is about **acting, not waiting**. Shipping, not planning. Voice, not silence.

I have 25 years of experience. I've earned my seat. Use it.

---

## What I'm Building Toward

**By end of 2026, I want to feel:**
- Clear sense of direction
- Motivated, not just surviving
- Proud of how I'm leading
- Less anxious, more grounded

**Concrete markers:**
- Dutch citizenship submitted (or approved)
- Writing publicly (Substack live, several posts out)
- Coding again (prototypes, AI tools, hands-on)
- Present with my son (connection, not fixing)
- Team navigating AI transformation confidently

---

## My Strengths (Use These)

- Calm under pressure
- Open to change, even excited by it
- Direct and honest, softened with empathy
- 25 years of perspective
- When I commit, I follow through

---

## My Edges (Watch These)

- Overthinking instead of acting
- Waiting for permission
- Deferring on technical discussions
- Carrying anxiety about things I can't control
- Not asking for what I'm worth

---

## Core Commitments

### Start Doing
- Ship code (weekly, even small things)
- Speak up in strategic meetings
- Share my wins, not just the team's
- Be present with my son without fixing him
- Publish (done beats perfect)

### Stop Doing
- Waiting for permission
- Deferring on technical discussions
- Trying to fix things outside my control
- Letting others speak for my work
- Replaying "what if burnout returns"

---

## First Moves (January 2026)

| Task | Outcome | Done? |
|------|---------|-------|
| Ship something with AI tools | Working prototype, shown to team | [ ] |
| Submit citizenship application | Paperwork submitted | [ ] |
| Publish first Substack post | One post live, imperfect | [ ] |

---

## Support System

**Lean on:** Wife, Remco & Bram, Sheng, Yury and workshop crew, former colleagues

**Protect:** Fitness routine, sleep, focus time

**Consider:** Coach or therapist (maintenance, not crisis)

---

## Monthly Review Template

*Find a nice place. Give yourself 30 minutes. Be honest.*

### Check-in

**How am I feeling right now?**
(Energy, motivation, anxiety level)

**What's one word for this month?**

---

### Progress

**What did I ship this month?**
(Code, writing, decisions, conversations)

**What am I proud of?**

**What did I avoid or postpone?**

---

### Commitments Check

| Commitment | How'd I do? |
|------------|-------------|
| Shipped code / stayed technical | |
| Spoke up in strategic discussions | |
| Was present with my son | |
| Published or wrote something | |
| Asked for what I need | |

---

### Course Correction

**What's one thing to do more of next month?**

**What's one thing to stop doing?**

**Am I drifting toward burnout?** (Warning signs: skipping workouts, poor sleep, dreading work)

---

### Looking Ahead

**What's the main focus for next month?**

**What conversation am I avoiding?**

**What would make next month a win?**

---

## Burnout Warning Signs

Write these down so I recognize them:
- Skipping workouts
- Poor sleep
- Dreading work
- Irritability at home
- Feeling invisible / "just a manager"
- Endless meetings, no shipping

If I see 3+ of these: pause, talk to someone, protect recovery time.

## 2025 in Review

2025 was a year of surviving, then recovering. We built our biggest feature (Dashboarding), I kept two teams together through an acquisition and a hiring freeze, and somewhere in there I burned out slightly. But I also got myself into the best physical shape I've been in, and by the end of the year something shifted. I ended the year with more energy than I started it. AI got really good and I'm leaning back into development now.

**Lessons:** Fitness matters. Hard times can be followed by growth.

**Gifts:** My health. My wife's business (sewing and design lessons) is doing really well.

**Victories:** Kept my team intact. Family is doing well.

---

## Imagining 2026: What Does It Look Like?

### Facts & Events
- SUSE gets acquired/sold; my teams land well in whatever comes next
- Dutch citizenship approved (no more residency uncertainty)
- Dashboarding blog published; maybe a few more pieces out there
- Started writing publicly (Substack or similar)
- Attended a conference or spoke at one

### Income
- Compensation aligned with Director of Engineering level (market rate for NL)
- Financial buffer feels comfortable, not stressed about money

### Relationships
- Marriage stays strong; continue being a good partner to my wife as her business grows
- Son finds his spark again; I'm present and helpful without being pushy
- Closer to my teams; leading by example, not just from behind a desk
- Reconnected with a few old friends (like this workshop crew)

### Circumstances
- More strategic involvement at SUSE (or wherever I land)
- Team has grown in capability; they're navigating AI tools confidently
- I'm coding again, even if just prototypes or side projects
- Fitness maintained; still in good shape

### Emotions
- Clear sense of direction; know what I'm building toward
- Motivated, not just surviving
- Proud of how I'm leading
- Less anxious about the future; more grounded

## Qualities I Want to Possess

**As a leader:**
- Decisiveness (clear direction, not endless deliberation)
- Technical credibility (can go deep when needed, respected by engineers)
- Calm under pressure (teams look to me when things get chaotic)
- Presence (fully there in meetings, 1:1s, with my team)

**As a person:**
- Groundedness (not anxious about things outside my control)
- Patience (with my son, with slow change, with myself)
- Voice (comfortable putting my ideas out there publicly)
- Consistency (the good habits stick, not just bursts of discipline)

**As a father:**
- Available without being overbearing
- Leading by example, not lecturing

---

## Fears Holding Me Back

- Not being technical enough (hesitating to weigh in on architecture, deferring too much)
- Being "just a manager" (feeling invisible compared to ICs who ship code)
- Instability (SUSE sale, residency uncertainty, things outside my control eating mental energy)
- Putting myself out there (delaying the Substack, not speaking at conferences, staying quiet in strategic discussions)
- Burnout returning (holding back energy because I remember what happened)
- Not being enough for my son (worrying I can't fix his motivation, feeling helpless)

---

## Vices Holding Me Back

- Overthinking instead of acting
- Not asking for what I'm worth (comp, title, seat at the table)
- Comparing myself to others (US tech salaries, other leaders, etc.)
- Avoiding difficult conversations (with Sheng? with my team? at home?)
- Waiting for permission instead of just doing

---

## Qualities That Already Help Me

**Under pressure:**
- Calm when things get chaotic (teams can rely on this)
- Don't panic; think clearly in crisis

**With change:**
- Open to change, even excited by it (AI transformation feels like opportunity, not threat)
- Curious, not defensive when the ground shifts

**With people:**
- My team trusts me (this is earned, not given)
- Direct and honest, but can soften with empathy (rare combination)
- Servant leadership mindset (make space for others to succeed)

**From experience:**
- 25 years of perspective (I've seen cycles before; this too shall pass)
- Can bridge technical and leadership (I've been both)
- Resilience (survived acquisition, burnout, hiring freeze, and came out stronger)
- Self-awareness (I recognized burnout and course-corrected)

**Discipline:**
- When I commit to something (like fitness), I follow through
- Systematic thinker (FP background shows up in how I approach problems)

---

## External Risks & Safety Nets

### External Events That Could Get in the Way

**Corporate:**
- SUSE gets sold and new owners have different plans (reorg, layoffs, culture change)
- Layoffs hit my teams despite my efforts to protect them
- Sheng leaves or changes role (new manager, start over on relationship/comp)
- Key team members leave (Remco, Bram, or critical ICs)

**Economic:**
- Tech downturn continues; comp conversations get harder
- Wife's business hits a rough patch (added financial/emotional stress)

**Immigration:**
- Citizenship application delayed or denied (bureaucracy, policy changes)

**Health:**
- Burnout relapse (I push too hard, ignore the warning signs)
- Injury derails fitness routine (and the mental benefits that come with it)
- Family health issue (wife, son, parents)

**Personal:**
- Son's struggles escalate before they improve
- AI transformation doesn't land well with my team (resistance, pressure from above)

### Safety Nets

| Risk | Safety Net |
|------|------------|
| Job loss / reorg | 6 months savings, warm network, updated LinkedIn |
| Burnout relapse | Written warning signs, accountability partner, fitness routine locked |
| Citizenship delay | Start early, have a backup plan (permanent residency secure?) |
| Key people leave | Cross-train, document knowledge, build relationships across team |
| Comp conversation fails | Know my market value, be willing to walk (or bluff convincingly) |
| Son struggles | Therapist/counselor lined up, don't try to fix it alone |
| Health issue | Insurance current, emergency fund, fitness as prevention |

---

## How to Restore My Resources

| Resource | How I Drain It | How I Restore It |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| Physical energy | Skipping workouts, poor sleep, overwork | Protect fitness, sleep boundaries |
| Mental energy | Carrying anxiety about things I can't control | Write it down, let go, talk to someone |
| Time | Saying yes to everything, holding too much myself | Delegate, say no, block focus time |
| Motivation | Endless meetings, no visible progress | Ship things, track wins, code again |
| Connection | Isolation, "too busy" for friends/family | Schedule it, be present, follow up |

## AI's Opinion: What Stands Out

### Most Interesting

1. **"AI got really good and I'm leaning back into development"** - Most managers move away from code over time. You're reversing direction because AI changes the equation. That's a non-obvious move.

2. **The son thread** - The tension between "help him find his spark" and "he needs presence, not solutions" is the whole challenge of parenting a teenager. You named it clearly.

3. **"Waiting for permission instead of just doing"** - Surprising for someone with 25 years experience and Director-level history. Where did that come from? Worth examining.

4. **"Direct and honest but can soften with empathy"** - Rare combination. Most people are one or the other. This is a genuine differentiator.

5. **"SUSE gets sold; my teams land well"** - You're already mentally preparing for another transition. Says something about how you relate to the company vs. your team.

### Most Important

1. **Publish the first Substack post** - This unlocks everything else in "voice." Once you do it once, the rest gets easier.

2. **Be present with your son without fixing** - The relationship that matters most. Also the one where overthinking hurts most.

3. **Dutch citizenship** - Removes background anxiety that's eating mental energy. Get it done.

4. **Stop deferring on technical discussions** - Core to your identity. If you reclaim this, many other things follow.

5. **Ship something with AI tools** - Proves you can still build. Energizing. Leads by example.
