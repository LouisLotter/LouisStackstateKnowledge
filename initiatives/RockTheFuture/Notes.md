# 2025 in Review

2025 was a year of surviving, then recovering. We built our biggest feature (Dashboarding), I kept two teams together through an acquisition and a hiring freeze, and somewhere in there I burned out slightly. But I also got myself into the best physical shape I've been in, and by the end of the year something shifted. I ended the year with more energy than I started it. AI got really good and I'm leaning back into development now.

**Lessons:** Fitness matters. Hard times can be followed by growth.

**Gifts:** My health. My wife's business (sewing and design lessons) is doing really well.

**Victories:** Kept my team intact. Family is doing well.

# Dreaming: 2026

## Ideal Year

**Business:** I manage to help my team through this crazy AI transformation.

**Personal:** My fitness and health is maintained and I manage to help my son get his spark and motivation back. Or find his inspiration. Becoming a Dutch citizen.

## Happiness

Become truly productive as an individual again. Lead by example. Inspire my son.

## Who or What

My son, my own focus growing and being sustained. Nothing crazy needed here I think. Becoming a Dutch citizen. No more worries about losing my right to live in the Netherlands.

# Qualities, Fears, and Vices

## Qualities I Want to Possess

**As a leader:**
- Decisiveness (clear direction, not endless deliberation)
- Technical credibility (can go deep when needed, respected by engineers)
- Calm under pressure (teams look to me when things get chaotic)
- Presence (fully there in meetings, 1:1s, with my team)

**As a person:**
- Groundedness (not anxious about things outside my control)
- Patience (with my son, with slow change, with myself)
- Voice (comfortable putting my ideas out there publicly)
- Consistency (the good habits stick, not just bursts of discipline)

**As a father:**
- Available without being overbearing
- Leading by example, not lecturing

## Fears Holding Me Back

- Not being technical enough (hesitating to weigh in on architecture, deferring too much)
- Being "just a manager" (feeling invisible compared to ICs who ship code)
- Instability (SUSE sale, residency uncertainty, things outside my control eating mental energy)
- Putting myself out there (delaying the Substack, not speaking at conferences, staying quiet in strategic discussions)
- Burnout returning (holding back energy because I remember what happened)
- Not being enough for my son (worrying I can't fix his motivation, feeling helpless)

## Vices Holding Me Back

- Overthinking instead of acting
- Not asking for what I'm worth (comp, title, seat at the table)
- Comparing myself to others (US tech salaries, other leaders, etc.)
- Avoiding difficult conversations (with Sheng? with my team? at home?)
- Waiting for permission instead of just doing

---

# Qualities That Already Help Me

**Under pressure:**
- Calm when things get chaotic (teams can rely on this)
- Don't panic; think clearly in crisis

**With change:**
- Open to change, even excited by it (AI transformation feels like opportunity, not threat)
- Curious, not defensive when the ground shifts

**With people:**
- My team trusts me (this is earned, not given)
- Direct and honest, but can soften with empathy (rare combination)
- Servant leadership mindset (make space for others to succeed)

**From experience:**
- 25 years of perspective (I've seen cycles before; this too shall pass)
- Can bridge technical and leadership (I've been both)
- Resilience (survived acquisition, burnout, hiring freeze, and came out stronger)
- Self-awareness (I recognized burnout and course-corrected)

**Discipline:**
- When I commit to something (like fitness), I follow through
- Systematic thinker (FP background shows up in how I approach problems)

---

# Qualities to Develop

- **Voice:** Put my ideas out there publicly (writing, speaking, strategic discussions)
- **Asking:** Ask for what I'm worth (comp, title, seat at the table)
- **Acting:** Move faster from thinking to doing
- **Letting go:** Release anxiety about things I can't control (SUSE sale, residency, my son's path)
- **Self-promotion:** Get comfortable talking about my wins (not just the team's)

---

# Start Doing

**Voice & visibility:**
- Publish that first Substack post (done beats perfect)
- Speak up in strategic meetings (I have 25 years of perspective; use it)
- Share my wins, not just the team's

**Development:**
- Code something every week (prototype, side project, pair with an engineer)
- Use AI tools hands-on so I can lead the transformation credibly

**Relationships:**
- Be present with my son without trying to fix him
- Reconnect with friends (this workshop is a start)

**Action bias:**
- Set a decision deadline when I catch myself overthinking
- Ship before it's ready; iterate after

---

# Stop Doing

**Mental traps:**
- Waiting for permission to act
- Replaying "what if burnout returns" (I know the warning signs now)

**Avoidance:**
- Deferring on technical discussions (I belong in those rooms)
- Postponing difficult conversations (Sheng, team, home)

**Over-functioning:**
- Trying to "fix" my son's motivation (he needs presence, not solutions)
- Carrying anxiety about things I can't control (SUSE sale, market, etc.)

**Hiding:**
- Keeping my ideas private
- Letting others speak for my work

---

# AI's Opinion: What Stands Out

## Most Interesting

1. **"AI got really good and I'm leaning back into development"** - Most managers move away from code over time. You're reversing direction because AI changes the equation. That's a non-obvious move.

2. **The son thread** - The tension between "help him find his spark" and "he needs presence, not solutions" is the whole challenge of parenting a teenager. You named it clearly.

3. **"Waiting for permission instead of just doing"** - Surprising for someone with 25 years experience and Director-level history. Where did that come from? Worth examining.

4. **"Direct and honest but can soften with empathy"** - Rare combination. Most people are one or the other. This is a genuine differentiator.

5. **"SUSE gets sold; my teams land well"** - You're already mentally preparing for another transition. Says something about how you relate to the company vs. your team.

## Most Important

1. **Have the comp conversation with Sheng** - Concrete, actionable, directly affects your sense of being valued. Do it early in 2026.

2. **Publish the first Substack post** - This unlocks everything else in "voice." Once you do it once, the rest gets easier.

3. **Be present with your son without fixing** - The relationship that matters most. Also the one where overthinking hurts most.

4. **Dutch citizenship** - Removes background anxiety that's eating mental energy. Get it done.

5. **Stop deferring on technical discussions** - Core to your identity. If you reclaim this, many other things follow.

# External Risks & Safety Nets

## External Events That Could Get in the Way

**Corporate:**
- SUSE gets sold and new owners have different plans (reorg, layoffs, culture change)
- Layoffs hit my teams despite my efforts to protect them
- Sheng leaves or changes role (new manager, start over on relationship/comp)
- Key team members leave (Remco, Bram, or critical ICs)

**Economic:**
- Tech downturn continues; comp conversations get harder
- Wife's business hits a rough patch (added financial/emotional stress)

**Immigration:**
- Citizenship application delayed or denied (bureaucracy, policy changes)

**Health:**
- Burnout relapse (I push too hard, ignore the warning signs)
- Injury derails fitness routine (and the mental benefits that come with it)
- Family health issue (wife, son, parents)

**Personal:**
- Son's struggles escalate before they improve
- AI transformation doesn't land well with my team (resistance, pressure from above)

## How to Prepare

**Financial buffer:**
- Build 6+ months expenses in savings if not already there
- Don't inflate lifestyle even if comp increases

**Network warm:**
- Stay connected to former colleagues (StackState alumni, NewMotion folks like Yury)
- LinkedIn updated, even if I'm not looking
- Know my market value (what would I ask for if I had to interview tomorrow?)

**Document my wins:**
- Keep a running list of achievements, metrics, impact
- Useful for comp conversations, performance reviews, or job searches

**Citizenship:**
- Start the application early in 2026 if I haven't already
- Don't let it sit in the "someday" pile

**Team resilience:**
- Develop people who can step up if key players leave
- Don't be a single point of failure myself

**Health non-negotiables:**
- Protect the fitness routine like a meeting I can't cancel
- Know my burnout warning signs (write them down)

## Safety Nets

| Risk | Safety Net |
|------|------------|
| Job loss / reorg | 6 months savings, warm network, updated LinkedIn |
| Burnout relapse | Written warning signs, accountability partner, fitness routine locked |
| Citizenship delay | Start early, have a backup plan (permanent residency secure?) |
| Key people leave | Cross-train, document knowledge, build relationships across team |
| Comp conversation fails | Know my market value, be willing to walk (or bluff convincingly) |
| Son struggles | Therapist/counselor lined up, don't try to fix it alone |
| Health issue | Insurance current, emergency fund, fitness as prevention |

# First Tasks for 2026

## 1. Ship something with AI tools

**Desired outcome:** Build a small prototype, script, or tool using AI-assisted development. Something I can show my team.

**Why this one:**
- I said "AI got really good and I'm leaning back into development" - act on that
- Leading the AI transformation from the front, not from behind a desk
- Proves to myself I can still ship
- Gives me credibility when I ask my team to adopt these tools
- It's energizing, not draining

**How it prepares me:** I become a leader who codes again. If SUSE goes sideways, I'm also more marketable. And I have something concrete to talk about (Substack post topic?).

---

## 2. Submit Dutch citizenship application

**Desired outcome:** Application submitted, paperwork out of my hands.

**Why this one:**
- Removes background anxiety that's eating mental energy
- It's administrative but emotionally significant
- Once submitted, I've done what I can (letting go practice)
- The longer I wait, the longer the uncertainty lasts

**How it prepares me:** Clears mental space. I stop carrying "I should do this" and start waiting for a result I can't control anyway.

---

## 3. Publish first Substack post

**Desired outcome:** One post live, public, imperfect. Doesn't matter if 5 people read it.

**Why this one:**
- Breaks the "waiting for permission" pattern
- Proves to myself I can put ideas out there
- Everything else in "voice" gets easier after the first one
- Done beats perfect

**How it prepares me:** I become someone who writes publicly. Identity shift. The second post is 10x easier.

---

## Why These Three?

| Task | Desired Outcome | Fear It Addresses | Quality It Builds |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Ship something with AI tools | Working prototype, shown to team | Being "just a manager", not technical enough | Technical credibility, action bias |
| Submit citizenship application | Paperwork submitted, out of my hands | Instability, things outside my control | Letting go, action bias |
| Publish first Substack post | One post live, imperfect, public | Putting myself out there, hiding | Voice, shipping |

All three are discrete January actions. All within my control (not dependent on SUSE's budget).

# Support & Restoration

## Who Can Support Me

**At home:**
- **Wife** - Partner, sounding board. Her business is thriving; she understands building something. Lean on her.
- **Son** - This goes both ways. Being present for him might restore me too. Connection, not just responsibility.

**At work:**
- **Remco & Bram** - My team leads. Trust them more. Delegate. They can carry weight so I don't have to hold everything.
- **My team** - They trust me. Let that be mutual. I don't have to have all the answers.
- **Sheng** - Even if comp is frozen, he's still my manager. Use the relationship for growth, feedback, air cover.

**Outside work:**
- **Yury and this workshop crew** - Friends reconnecting. People in similar boats. Don't let this be a one-time thing.
- **Former colleagues** - StackState alumni, NewMotion folks. Keep the network warm.
- **A coach or therapist?** - Given burnout history, having someone outside the system to talk to isn't weakness. It's maintenance.

## How to Restore My Resources

**Physical energy:**
- Fitness routine is working - protect it like a non-negotiable meeting
- Sleep - no amount of productivity hacks replace this
- Don't let work eat into recovery time

**Mental energy:**
- Let go of things outside my control (citizenship, SUSE sale, son's path)
- Reduce decision fatigue - routines, defaults, less deliberation on small things
- Write things down so my brain stops holding them

**Time:**
- Say no more often
- Delegate to Remco & Bram - that's what leads are for
- Fewer meetings, more blocks for real work (coding, thinking, writing)

**Motivation:**
- Do things that energize: coding, shipping, conversations that matter
- Avoid things that drain: endless meetings, politics, performative work
- Track wins - remind myself progress is happening

**Connection:**
- Schedule time with friends, not just "we should catch up"
- Be present at home, not just physically there
- This workshop is a start - follow up with people

## What Support Looks Like in Practice

| Resource | How I Drain It | How I Restore It |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| Physical energy | Skipping workouts, poor sleep, overwork | Protect fitness, sleep boundaries |
| Mental energy | Carrying anxiety about things I can't control | Write it down, let go, talk to someone |
| Time | Saying yes to everything, holding too much myself | Delegate, say no, block focus time |
| Motivation | Endless meetings, no visible progress | Ship things, track wins, code again |
| Connection | Isolation, "too busy" for friends/family | Schedule it, be present, follow up |
