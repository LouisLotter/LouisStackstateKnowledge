Settings

Decouple Settings from topology
Settings, quite dependent on CRUD, transactionality and referential integrity. Easy with postgres but not clickhouse. Or sqlite.
Not everything is behind the settings service.
Keep settings in STackgraph first and make stackgraph non HA small instance.

Health States are stored on topology. Should be easy.
Events. How we trigger and rely on topology changed events.

Benefits:	
Clickhouse can:
	Can enter data for any timestamp at any time. Stackgraph cannot
	Much closer to observed time rather than ingestion time.
	SQL to explore the data. Suggestions can be better etc.
	Better Pagination.
	Easier experimentation and troubleshooting.
	Higher level API’s Dev ex is much better.
	More transferable skills.

Why use Clickhouse.
	It’s a DB we already have. Are backing up etc.

What would the success criteria look like ?
Remove the risk. Know that performance is good enough.
